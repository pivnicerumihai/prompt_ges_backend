    WebApp: "Gas Engineer Software is a robust job management application that encompasses a multitude of features for efficient job and customer management. This software has the capability to produce a wide array of certificates. For domestic purposes, it can create Homeowner Gas Certificates, Landlord Gas Safety Certificates, Gas Warning Notices, and Gas Breakdown Services, amongst others. For non-domestic applications, the software is equipped to generate ND Gas Safety Records, Lpg Safety Records, Leisure Industry Gas Records, ND Gas Testing and Purging Records, and ND Catering Records. Moreover, it is adept at issuing Domestic Oil certificates such as CD10, CD11, CD12, CD14, TI133. Other records like Legionella Risk Assessment, Minor Electrical Works Record, Unvented Hot Water Cylinder Records, Job Sheets, and Cover Letters can also be produced.The software facilitates a comprehensive storage system for customer information. Each client entry can have an associated multitude of job addresses, and each job address can encapsulate numerous jobs. It's easy to issue estimates, quotes, and invoices for each job configured within the system. The storage for each customer's record allows for capturing contact information and address. For every Job Address, there's room for storing the address information, tenant details if applicable, as well as detailed specifications of Gas and Oil Appliances. The software lets you specify the Gas Service Due Date at the job address level and the Oil Appliance Service Due Date for each oil appliance associated with that job address. All the entities, including customer, job address, and job, are designed to keep a comprehensive history of records. Additional features of the software include the ability to attach photos to job entries. Scheduling tasks and appointments is streamlined either through the job page or directly from the Calendar page. Information such as notes for the appointment, the engineer assigned, and the start and end time can be defined.For creating a new customer, one needs to navigate to 'Customers' from the header menu and then click on 'Add Customer', fill in the required fields and hit 'Save'. Job Addresses can be added either from the customer page by clicking on 'Add Job Address' or directly from the 'Job Addresses' section in the header menu. Similar pathways exist for creating jobs - they can be initiated from the customer page, the job address page, or directly from the 'Jobs' page.Creating estimates, quotes, or invoices can be accomplished by navigating to 'Create New' from the header menu and selecting the relevant option or from the job page itself. The software organizes the data in lists on the Customers, Job Addresses, and Jobs pages, which can be accessed directly from the header menu.One crucial feature of the software is soft deletion. Instead of permanently erasing the records, the 'Delete' function moves them to an 'Archived' section. These archived records can be accessed from the 'Archived' tab on each entity's list page and in the job history, marked with an '(archived)' label in their names. The software also provides a 'Restore' function to recover any archived record if required.The software includes a designated 'Invoices' tab in the header, which directs you to a page containing a list of all unpaid invoices upon clicking. This page also includes several additional tabs for 'Paid Invoices', 'Reconciled', 'Drafts', and 'Archived' invoices.Adding a payment to an invoice is straightforward. It can be accomplished either through the job's history or directly from the invoice list by clicking 'Add Payment'.It's important to remember that all records, whether certificates or invoices, are not issued until you click 'Approve'. If you simply click 'Save', these will be stored as drafts. To issue drafts, you can open the draft records from the job history and then click 'Approve'. If any record is edited without clicking 'Approve' again, it will revert to draft status, hence always ensure you click 'Approve'. Each record features 'Approve' or 'Approve & Email' options. 'Approve' merely issues the record, while 'Approve & Email' directs you to the email page, enabling you to send the record via email.Accessing the 'Calendar' page from the header menu presents a list of engineers, each color-coded, associated with the current GES account on the right-hand side. Upon creation of a calendar event, an engineer can be assigned to it, with the event reflecting the assigned engineer's color. The 'Settings' tab in the header menu offers numerous configuration options, including 'Company Settings' that enable editing your company information. Fields requiring input include 'Company Name' (with a checkbox to display this on certificates), company registration number, VAT number, Gas Safe registration number, a dropdown to select a body from a list including OFTEC, APHC, NAPIT, Benchmark, BESCA, Certsure, HETAS and a corresponding input field for the selected body's registration number, 'Default currency' for invoices, quotes, and estimates, inputs for Legionella Risk Assessment details, and fields for company contact details. A 'CC all emails to Admin Email' checkbox reroutes all emails to the admin email if checked. A 'Company Website' field, 'Company Tagline' field, and a 'Upload Logo' option for company logo round out the offerings. The logo appears on all issued records, with the Gas Safe Register logo set by default. The 'Users' section under the 'Settings' tab presents a list of users associated with your account. Each user is displayed with an 'Enable' or 'Disable' button, where users with the 'Enable' button are currently disabled, and enabling them will increment the license count on your subscription. The user list displays each user's Name, Email, ID card number, phone number, signature, and Enable/Disable status. Clicking on a user opens a frame containing editable user information, including Email, Full Name, Mobile, Password (with retype password for resetting the user's password), Gas Safe ID Card Number, and Oil Registration Number. User's current signature is displayed at the top right of this frame alongside user permissions. A whiteboard at the bottom allows users to update their signature. User permissions include 'Invoice' (permission to issue invoices), 'Calendar' (access to view other users' assigned events, without which users only see their own events), and 'Restricted' (when enabled, restricts user access to only the mobile app, limiting visibility to only those customers, job addresses, and jobs assigned to them via Calendar events).The 'Invoice Payment Terms And Certificate Numbering' selection in the 'Settings' page enables configuration of invoice and gas certificate numbering formats. The 'Payment Terms and Bank Details' section contains fields, displayed on every invoice, including: Bank Name, Name on Account, Sort Code, Account Number, and Payment Terms. The 'Certificate, Record, Quote and Invoice Numbering' section lists all available certificates in the software ( Homeowner Gas Certificates, Landlord Gas Safety Certificates, Gas Warning Notices, Gas Breakdown Services, ND Gas Safety Records, Lpg Safety Records, Leisure Industry Gas Records, ND Gas Testing and Purging Records,  ND Catering Records,  CD10, CD11, CD12, CD14, TI133, Legionella Risk Assessment, Minor Electrical Works Record, Unvented Hot Water Cylinder Records, Job Sheets), each accompanied by a 'Prefix' and 'Number' input field. Each certificate carries a prefix (if set) and a number, which increments by one each time a new certificate of that type is issued. These inputs allow users to assign a prefix to certificates and modify the numerical value used for each certificate type.The 'Service Reminders and Email Templates' section under 'Settings' offers the ability to edit templates used when sending emails. These templates cater to various types of records, including Annual Gas Service Reminders, Oil Service Reminders, and Invoice Payment Received Email. Upon selecting a record type, you can edit the email subject and body of its associated template. There are several variables available to populate the template, including :title for customer title, :firstname for customer forename, :lastname for customer surname, :customer for customer company or formal name, :jobbuilding for job address building, :jobstreet for job address street, :jobref for job customer ref, :propertyaddress for property full address, :contactphone for your phone number, :companyname for your company name, :engineername for engineer name, :jobregion for job address region, :jobpostcode for job address postcode, and :jobtown for Job Town. If the template selected is a reminder such as Annual Gas Reminder or Oil reminder the user can also choose how many before the service is due the reminder to be sent .The 'SMS Reminder Settings' is another section under 'Settings'. Initially, this feature is disabled. To activate it, you need to click on the Manage button inside the section andto input their phone numbers in the 'SMS Number:' field and select 'SMS reminder setup'. This sends a request to the support team. As part of the setup process, a confirmation code is sent to the user's provided phone number, which needs to be forwarded to the support team. Once setup is complete, the support team will confirm the successful activation of SMS reminders. Following this setup, an SMS reminder will be sent to customers when a property service is due. The page's top section displays SMS templates for both Gas and Oil reminders, which can be modified using the same variables as in emails. SMS usage is not included in the subscription price. Additional SMS credits can be purchased by selecting the 'Buy Now' button, with the pricing as follows: 100 SMS Credits = Â£10.00 + VAT.The next seciton in 'Settings' is the  'Integration Settings' section that allows users to link Gas Engineer Software with other software applications such as Quickbooks, Sage, Xero (accounting software), and Mailchimp (email marketing software). To initiate the integration, users must click 'Authenticate' for Sage or Mailchimp, or 'Connect to Quickbooks'/'Connect to Xero' for Quickbooks and Xero respectively, then follow the provided integration steps. Upon successful integration, users can sync data with the accounting software by ticking 'sync customers to [selected accounting software]' and 'sync invoices to [selected accounting software]', then clicking 'save'. This will sync all future customers and invoices with the chosen accounting software. Previous customers and invoices are not retroactively synced, but if invoices are reissued, a new sync is triggered. For Mailchimp, there is a 'sync customers to Mailchimp' checkbox that needs to be checked post-authentication. Any future users created in Gas Engineer Software will then receive an email requesting a 'Subscribe' response to appear on the Mailchimp subscribers list. Customers from before the integration won't receive this email unless the user triggers a resync by opening the Customer page and clicking 'Save'. The final section within the 'Settings' is the 'Manage Subscription' option. This feature enables users to handle and adjust their subscription details with the Gas Engineer Software. ",

    MobileApp: "On the home screen, you have the following options: New Record, New Estimate/Quote/Invoice, Calendar, Customers, Job Addresses, Jobs, Gas Rate Calculator, Existing Records & Drafts, and Settings. Tapping on 'New Record' allows you to choose from a diverse set of records that include Domestic Gas Records such as Homeowner Gas Safety Record, Landlord Gas Safety, Gas Warning Notice, Gas Service Record, Gas Breakdown Record, Non-Domestic Gas Records like ND Gas Safety Record, Leisure Industry Gas Safety Record, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Safety Record, ND Gas Testing & Purging, ND Catering, Domestic Oil Records comprising of CD10 Oil Firing Installation Completion Record, CD11 Oil Firing Servicing and Commissioning Record, CD12 Landlord Oil Installation Check, CD14 Warning and Advice Notice, TI133D Domestic Oil Storage Tank, and Miscellaneous Records like Legionella Risk Assessment, Minor Electrical Works Record, Unvented Hot Water Cylinder. All records are presented in a list, each accompanied by a star icon on the left. When tapped, the star turns blue, marking the record as a favourite and placing it at the top of the list for quick access.All records are listed with a star icon to their left; tapping this star turns it blue and moves the record to the top of the list under the 'Favourites' category. Tapping a record takes you to the job list, offering two choices: select an existing job and fill out the record, or click on 'Add New Job'. If you choose an existing job and it's a gas inspection record, you can set the property's next inspection due date, change the issue date, and add a customer signature on the final screen. The default next inspection date is either a year from today or a year from the previous due date if the certificate was issued within two months of a service date. When you 'Add New Job', you're taken to the 'Customers' List where you can either select an existing customer and update their details and job addresses, or add a new customer and fill out their information. Both paths lead you to the Job Address screen where you'll fill out or confirm details before proceeding to complete the certificate. The first screen of appliance-supporting certificates is the 'Appliances' screen, which displays any existing property appliances, or allows you to add new ones using the '+' icon. From the home screen, selecting 'New Estimate, Quote or Invoice' opens a screen with three options: 'Invoice', 'Quote', and 'Estimate'. These options function similarly to creating a new record, except they lead to the creation of an invoice, quote, or estimate. The 'Calendar' option, also on the home screen, provides various features based on user permissions. If the user has full permissions, they see a list of all calendar events created for all engineers on the account, with the current month shown at the top left. Clicking on the month opens a calendar for day-specific event viewing. Two buttons are located at the top right: a '+' button for creating new events, and a button for toggling between day and week views, with day view as the default.Calendar screen contains a rich set of details like event type (options include Meeting, Call, To Do, Quote, Installation, Servicing, Plumbing, Reference, Repairs, Training, Unconfirmed, Business Holidays, Employee Holidays), the customer assigned to the event, their job address, the time of day when the calendar event is scheduled, the engineer assigned to the event, and the activity outcome (choices being 'None selected','Completed', 'Cancelled', 'No Access','Needs Part - To Be Ordered','Needs Part - On Order', 'Needs Follow up with Senior Engineer'). Selecting any event triggers the 'Event Details' screen with all event information, and options to view the associated customer, job address, and job details or initiate a new record creation for the job linked to that event. Clicking on 'Create New Record' directs user to the record list from where they can select the record and proceed with creating it. Interacting with 'view customer', 'job address' or 'job' brings up editable information pertaining to that entity. A 'pen and paper' icon on the top right corner of this event, when clicked, allows alteration of event's information like engineer assigned, start and end time, addition of notes, modification of activity type and outcome. Altering the selected customer, job address and job or selecting one if none are assigned can also be performed by interacting with 'Select Customer', 'Select Job Address', and 'Select Job'."
